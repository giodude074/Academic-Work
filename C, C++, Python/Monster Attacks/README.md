### Specifications:
Lab 3
Write a C program that keeps a linked list of monster attack structs.

```
Start with the linked list and your monster_attack struct from Lab 2.  Make all the menu 
options work with a linked list of monster attacks.
Put the menu to a code file called linked_list_demo.c.
Use header files. 
You will need to code a way to show data for each monster attack. After each menu option, you should see output for each attack. You will also need to write a function to take 
user input for each monster attack. 
The search function should search for a monster attack by its id.
```
