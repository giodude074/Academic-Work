### Specifications:

Write a recursive method to compute `m(i) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3, ... + 1/i`, where i is an Int greater than zero.

Write a recursive method to compute `m(i) = 1/2, + 2/3, ... + i/(i + 1)`, where i is an Int greater than 0.

Using recursion, implement a method that removes the max element from a list of Ints, or if there are duplicates of the max element, just remove one of them.

Implement a sorting algorithm that finds the max, puts it at the end of the list, then recursively sorts the remainder of the list.
