### Specifications:

Write a Java program that does the following tasks:

```
    Declares an int with value 42 and casts it to a double
    Declares a double variable with the value 49.9 and casts it to an int
    Declares an int variable with the value -2147483647, then subtracts 1. Ouput the value both before and after the addition.
    Declares an int variable with the value -2147483648, prints out the value, then subtracts 1 and prints out the value, then subtracts 1 again and prints out the value.
    Calculates the volume of a sphere this way:
        Declares a final double.
		Show the result to exactly three digits past the decimal point.
    Converts your height in inches to your height in centimeters this way:
        Creates a final double called INCHESTOCM. Use the formula CM = inches * INCHESTOCM.
    Uses the formula C = (F - 32) * 5/9 to convert the following values from Fahrenheit to Celsius: -40, 0, and 212
    Tests two values for divisibility by 7 this way:
        Creates an int variable, sets its value to 111, and uses modulo to determine whether the value is evenly divisible by 7
        Assigns the new value 112 to the int variable, and uses modulo to determine whether the value is evenly divisible by 7
    Determines and outputs whether it is true that 1 + 2 is less than 10 but false that 5 > 7
    Declares variables of the appropriate types and sets them to your age in years and GPA (no need to tell the truth) and determines whether
        a) either your age is greater than 25 or your GPA is greater than 3.0
        b) your age is greater than 25 *and* your GPA is also greater than 3.0.
    In each case, write code that evaluates the expression and sets the value of a boolean variable to the result, then print the value of the variable.
