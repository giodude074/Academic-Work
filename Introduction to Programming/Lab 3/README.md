### Specifications:

Write a Java program that does the following:

```
    Prompts the user for the following information and stores the input in appropriate variables:
    Whether the user is left-handed
    Whether the user's father was less than 5 ft 8 inches tall
    The user's age in months
    The name of a sibling or friend of the user
    The age in months of the sibling or friend
    The user's GPA
    The displacement in liters of the user's car engine
```

Prints out the following information, using System.out.println() for the output:

```
    a) Whether the user is left-handed
    b) Whether the user's father was less than 5 ft 8 inches tall
    c) Whether at least one of the values from a and b are true (true if either or both are true)
    d) Whether a and b are both true (false if at least one is false)
    e) Whether the truth values of a and b are the same (true if both a and b are true or if both a and b are false)
    f) Whether the user is older than his/her sibling/friend (as far as we can tell from the ages in months.) Show the sibling or friend's name in the output (eg, "Sally is older than you!"
    g) Whether the user's age in months is within 18 months of the age of the sibling/friend. You may want to use Math.abs(), which computes the absolute value of a number, for this.
    h) Whether the user's age in months is evenly divisible by 6
    i) Whether the user's GPA is at least equal to the displacement in liters of his/her car engine
