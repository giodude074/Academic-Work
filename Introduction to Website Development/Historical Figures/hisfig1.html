				<p class="intro">
				At the time Mary Anning lived, scientists were just beginning to 
				appreciate the significance of fossils--recognizing them as the 
				remains of long-extinct creatures, rather than the rare skeletons 
				of still-living animals. Not a trained scientist herself, Anning 
				got into fossil collecting as a way of making money: when she was 
				12 years old, she found an ichthyosaur skeleton on the English coast, 
				and she discovered the first-ever plesiosaur fossil ten years later. 
				By this time she had come to the attention of the British scientific 
				establishment, which must not have been surprised when she managed to 
				dig up a Dimorphodon (a genus of pterosaur that, until then, had 
				never been identified outside Germany).

				Mary Anning's upbringing had a lot to do with her later notoriety. 
				Even when she was a child, the English town of Lyme Regis was known for 
				its unusual fossils, mostly of marine animals like ammonites and 
				belemnites dating to the early Jurassic period. During the Napoleonic Wars,
				before Mary had reached her teens, her father took her and her brother out to 
				collect fossils and sell them to curious visitors, since the upheavals across 
				the English Channel had a dismal effect on the local economy (in fact, Anning's 
				father was himself involved in organizing protests against food shortages).

				<p class = "legacy">
				By the time she died, at the age of 47, Mary Anning had received a lifetime 
				annuity from the British Association for the Advancement of Science--not a small 
				honor at a time when women weren't expected to be literate, much less capable of 
				making scientific discoveries. Anning was memorialized even more effectively by 
				a popular tongue-twister written by Terry Sullivan in the late nineteenth 
				century: "She sells sea shells by the sea shore."
