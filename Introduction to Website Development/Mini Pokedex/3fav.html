							Pokemon (Japanese:Pocket Monsters, 
							Pokémon for short) is an overarching media 
							franchise owned by Nintendo, Creatures, Inc., and Game
							Freak. First appearing in 1996 with the release of its 
							first entries on the Game Boy, the game series has since
							inspired an array of media, including an anime, a card 
							game, numerous manga, and various spin-off games.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							The series focuses on the creatures known as Pokémon, 
							as well as their inhabited world, full of legends, tales, 
							and adventures. Several interpretations of the world explore
							different themes and elements. Most commonly, Pokémon coexist 
							with humans and can be caught, trained, and used in battles
							and other activities. Trainers, along with their Pokémon, 
							travel across diverse lands aiming to make their dreams become 
							reality

								Gengar (Japanese: Gangar) is a dual-type Ghost/Poison Pokémon. 
								It evolves from Haunter when traded. It is the final form of Gastly. It
								can Mega Evolve into
								Mega Gengar using the Gengarite. Gengar is very mischievous, and at times,
								malicious. It enjoys playing practical jokes and casting curses, such as 
								pretending to be one's shadow, then behaving erratically. When the quarry 
								notices, the Gengar takes delight in its victim's terror. However, Gengar 
								has been known to be loyal to a Trainer who treats it well. Gengar lives 
								in shadows of rooms, caves, and dark places where shadows form. It is
								especially fond of urban areas such as cities and back alleys, but only 
								during the night.

								Snorlax (Japanese: Kabigon) is a Normal-type Pokémon.
								It evolves from Munchlax when leveled up with high friendship.
								In the Generation I and II games and their remakes, wild Snorlax 
								can be found sleeping in inconvenient locations throughout Kanto. 
								<strong> In order to catch one, a Trainer must first awaken it with 
								music from either a Poké Flute</strong> or Pokégear set to the Poké 
								Flute channel. Snorlax is often 
								found in mountains and forests. It wakes up only to eat and seldom for
								exercises. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to 
								eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. When hungry, it is 
								not satisfied until it consumes 900 pounds of food. Snorlax is docile
								enough to let children and small Pokémon bounce on its large stomach.

								Alakazam (Japanese:Foodin) is a Psychic-type Pokémon. It evolves from Kadabra 
								when traded. It is the final form of Abra. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Alakazam
								using the Alakazite.
								Alakazam is able to use all forms of psychic abilities. These powers are used to
								move its body, as opposed to its weak muscles. It also uses its psychic powers to
								hold up its head, which is too heavy to be supported by its neck, due to its 
								continually growing brain. It is said to have an excellent memory and can 
								remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, and has 
								an IQ that exceeds 5,000. It is found in urban areas.
