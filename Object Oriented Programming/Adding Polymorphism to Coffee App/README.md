### Specifications:

```
Create two packages in your src folder, one for the main program, and one for model classes. 
Put Main.java in the main package and put Order and Drink in the model package.  

 Create these classes: Coffee, Tea, Blended, Soda. Put them in the models package. Constructor takes in a single int and sets the size field to that value. 

 Override the calcCost method in each to return the cost of the drink, given its size.

 Override the toString method to print out the drink's size, type, and cost in the same format as HW1 required.
