### Specifications:

Using the UI you developed in the last lab implement all of the functionality of the command line coffee shop program:

```
 Drink and Order classes are used appropriately. 

 All buttons and tabs have the appropriate event listeners attached.

 Drinks can be added to an order.

 Orders are displayed appropriately in a ListView
 ```

Add persistence to the program:

```
 For each order completed, store the drinks on a line in a csv file (one order per line) by first printing an id number, then the drinks (identifiable by an integer), then an end of line marker. Don't store any derived data (like order total or prices of drinks). 

 In the Orders tab of the application, display all orders in a Listview as follows: The order id and the order total. 

 extra credit: When someone clicks a item in the Orders ListView, display another listview with all of the drinks in the order. You may do this in another tab if you want, or replace the existing ListView, or put it in another ListView next to the first. If you do the second option, make a "back" button appear to get to the Orders view.
