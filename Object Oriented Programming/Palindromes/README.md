### Specifications:

```
Create Palindrome, NumericPalindrome, and TextPalindrome classes. They are subclasses of Palindrome.

The NumberPalindrome checks for palindromes of digits only. The TextPalindrome checks for palindromes of text chars only. 

Each of these classes have a method called "checkPalindrome()" and "getNumberOfPalindromes()". The first checks a string. The second gets a text file and loops through it, counting the number of the appropriate palindromes in it. The subclasses override methods (you choose which) from the super class to do this.

Test them.
