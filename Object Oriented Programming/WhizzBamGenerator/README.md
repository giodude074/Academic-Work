### Specifications:

```
Using Eclipse, create Main.java with a main method. Use this method to test your other methods.

Create a static method (name it whatever you want, within reason) that takes a String as an argument. It returns the reverse of the String passed into it. Do this by getting the character array from the string and reversing the characters using a loop of your choice. Pass this modified character array into a String constructor to make the new String. 

In the main method, create a Scanner instance and prompt the user to enter a string. 

Create a static method (name it whatever you want, within reason) with no arguments that, using a loop, prints the numbers from 0 to 100, each on a new line. When the number is divisible by 4, have it also print "Whizz" on the same line. When the number is divisible by 6, have it also print "Bam" on the same line. When the number is divisible by both, have it also print "Whizz Bam"  once on the same line (do not print any additional Whizzes and Bams). 

Call this Whizz-Bam generator method in your main method.
