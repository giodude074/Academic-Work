### Specifications:

```
1) Problem Definition: 
Write a program that reads an unspecified number of integers and finds the one that has the most occurrences. The input ends when the input is 0. For example, if you entered 2 3 4 3 42 3 4 3 3 0. the number 3 occurred most often. If not one but several numbers have the most occurrences, all of them should be reported.

2) Write a recursive program computes Fibonacci numbers. Then, rewrite it using dynamic programing. Test both of your programs for n = 10, 20, 40 and find out execution time for each cases.
