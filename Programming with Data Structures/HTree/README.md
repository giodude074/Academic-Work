### Specifications: H-tree fractal

Problem Description:

```
An H-tree is a fractal defined as follows:
1. Begin with a letter H. The three lines of the H are of the same length,
2. The letter H (in its sans-serif form, H) has four endpoints. Draw an H centered
at each of the four endpoints to an H-tree of order 1, These
Hâ€™s are half the size of the H that contains the four endpoints.
3. Repeat step 2 to create a H-tree of order 2, 3, ..., and so on,

The H-tree is used in VLSI design as a clock distribution network for routing
timing signals to all parts of a chip with equal propagation delays. Write an applet
that draws an H-tree, as shown in the figure.
