### Specifications:

```
Extra Credit: Part 1
Create your own database, part 1
Think of a topic that can utilize a database; it can be anything (so long as it's family friendly).
Then, think of three (3) tables that correspond to this database.
Write a brief description for each field (refer to the midterm fictional database format).
```

```
Create your own database, part 2
Using the tables from part 1, use DML and DDL to turn these into actual SQL tables. 

Once you're done, come up with 4 or more relevant queries for your new database. In your queries, you must have at least one result in a join,
two with subqueries, and ALL must have English to SQL results.

Turn in the database in a script. Turn your description and queries in a txt file.
