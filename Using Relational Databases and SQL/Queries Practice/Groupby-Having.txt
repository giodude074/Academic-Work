CS 122 Lab 6: GROUP BY and HAVING




1) Find the total number of tracks produced by each studio.

SELECT s.studioname, COUNT(tr.tracktitle) AS TotalTracks
FROM tracks tr JOIN titles t ON (tr.titleID = t.titleID)
JOIN studios s ON (t.studioID = s.studioID)
GROUP BY studioname;




2)Find the region(s) with multiple members (i.e. regions with more than one member).

SELECT m.region, COUNT(M.Firstname) AS MembersINRegions
FROM members m
GROUP BY region;






3)Count how many genres of albums have been produced, out of ALL POSSIBLE GENRES.

SELECT g.genre, COUNT(t.title) 
FROM genre g left join titles t on(g.genre= t.genre)
GROUP BY genre;





4) Find the total number of artists (groups) per country, and find the average artist name length per country.


SELECT a.artistname, COUNT(a.country) AS ArtistsPerCountry
FROM artists a
GROUP BY country
HAVING avg(artistname);



LENGTH()





5)Create a view that lists the first and last names of every person in the database (in members and salespeople).
(Hint: Combine all names in members and salespeople. DO NOT USE JOINS.)
Take a screenshot of this view.
Using the view, list how many people have first names longer than 6 letters. 

CREATE VIEW Everyone AS
SELECT s.firstname, s.lastname,m.firstname, m.lastname
FROM Salespeople s JOIN Members m USING(SalesID)
GROUP BY SalesID;



show tables;     // to view the above view as a virtual table in your list of tables




6)Find the total number of mp3's produced by each studio. If each mp3 is $3 apiece on Itunes, find the dollar amount expected per studio if 1000 people buy each mp3. 
Put this all in one table with Columns Listed:
"Studio", "Total MP3s", "Dollar Value"

SELECT s.studioname, count(mp3) as 'Totalmp3s'
FROM tracks tr left join titles t on (tr.titleID = t.titleID)
left join studios s on (t.studioID= s.studioID)



7)Find member names that have helped produce fewer than 10 tracks. 
(Keep in mind there are members with NO tracks at all).
Put these in DESCENDING order by number of tracks. 
Explain your answer. 

Select m.firstname COunt(tr.tracktitle)
FROM tracks tr INNER JOIN titles ti ON tr.titleID = ti.titleID
INNER JOIN artists ar ON tr.artistID = ti.artistID
INNER JOIN Members me ON me.artistID =  ar.artistID
Group by firstname
HAVING (tracks <= 10)
ORDER BY firstname DESC;
