```
In this assignment you are to create a Tic Tac Toe game using JSP Scripting elements and a JSP page.  Your game should allow two human players to play a game of Tic Tac Toe.  You can assume the players are sharing a computer, and will simply take turns clicking a free space.

Your game should allow Users to simply click on a free space to place their marker.  Do not make a User manually type in an index of a cell.

If a player wins, display a message indicating so.  If there are no winners, and no additional moves can be made, declare the game a tie.
